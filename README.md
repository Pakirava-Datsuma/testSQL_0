# testSQL_0
test task for Luxsoft

Unfortunately I have no MS Excel on my Ubuntu. 
So file *pivot.xlsx* is created [in Google Documents]
    (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1myVVEPBee5vNKpeOcKKNXWMwzOdEakxGpPsHRVbKQmg/edit?usp=sharing). 
And for speeding up solving process I used [online MySQL server]
    (http://sqlfiddle.com/) 
instead of installing local one.
